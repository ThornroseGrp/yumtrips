# December 2024 Fixes and Updates

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Scrolling Issue ✅
- Added `overflow-x-hidden` to both `html` and `body` elements in globals.css
- Set `height: 100%` on html and `min-height: 100%` on body
- Added `position: relative` to body to ensure proper layout containment
- This prevents the infinite scroll up issue where white space appears

### 2. Added Cover Photos to Day Cards ✅
- Updated the trip homepage (`/app/[tripId]/page.tsx`) to use specific cover photos
- Day cards now display `cover-day-1.webp`, `cover-day-2.webp`, and `cover-day-3.webp`
- Photos are properly overlaid with 30% opacity behind the gradient
- Both oki25 and charleston25 trips have their respective cover photos

### 3. File Structure
The current yumtrips folder structure is organized as follows:

## Technical Details

### Scroll Fix Implementation
```css
/* In globals.css */
@layer base {
  html {
    @apply scroll-smooth overflow-x-hidden;
    height: 100%;
  }
  
  body {
    @apply antialiased overflow-x-hidden;
    min-height: 100%;
    position: relative;
  }
}
```

### Cover Photo Implementation
```typescript
// In app/[tripId]/page.tsx
{itinerary.map((day, index) => {
  // Use specific cover photo for each day
  const coverPhotoName = `cover-day-${index + 1}.webp`;
  const backgroundPhoto = `photos/${tripId}/${coverPhotoName}`;
  
  // Photo is displayed with 30% opacity behind gradient
  <img
    src={`/${backgroundPhoto}`}
    alt={day.title}
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover opacity-30"
  />
})}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the scroll fix** - Navigate to any trip page and try scrolling up. The issue should be resolved.

2. **Verify cover photos** - Check that each day card shows its appropriate theme photo:
   - Day 1: Landing/arrival theme
   - Day 2: Main activities theme  
   - Day 3: Departure/farewell theme

3. **Consider adding more cover photos** for future trips or seasonal variations

4. **Naming Convention**: Always use `cover-day-{number}.webp` format for consistency

## Notes

- The cover photos are trip-specific and stored in `/public/photos/{tripId}/`
- Each cover photo should be optimized (under 200KB) and in WebP format
- The 30% opacity ensures text remains readable while adding visual interest
- The scroll fix is applied globally and affects all pages in the app
