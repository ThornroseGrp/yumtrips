# ✅ Public Folder Fixed!

## What was done:

### 1. **Photo Organization**
- Created `/public/photos/oki25/` folder for Beach 'n Boil photos
- Created `/public/photos/charleston25/` folder for Charleston photos
- Moved all 52 Oak Island photos to `oki25/`
- Moved all 47 Charleston photos to `charleston25/`

### 2. **Updated Photo References**
- All Oak Island itinerary photo paths now include `oki25/` prefix
- Charleston photos are ready in their folder
- Cover photos updated in trips configuration

### 3. **Manifest Update**
- Updated app name to "Yumtrips"
- Updated description for multi-trip platform
- Maintained PWA functionality

## Current Structure:
```
/public/
├── manifest.json      # Updated for Yumtrips
├── sw.js             # Service worker for PWA
└── photos/
    ├── oki25/        # 52 Beach 'n Boil photos
    │   ├── oak-island-*.webp
    │   ├── beach-*.webp
    │   ├── seafood-boil-*.webp
    │   └── ... (all trip photos)
    └── charleston25/ # 47 Charleston photos
        ├── rainbow-row-*.webp
        ├── french-quarter-inn-*.webp
        ├── charleston-*.webp
        └── ... (all Charleston photos)
```

## Photo Counts:
- **Oak Island (oki25)**: 52 photos properly organized
- **Charleston (charleston25)**: 47 photos ready for use

## Next Steps:
1. Add any missing PWA icons (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`)
2. Test the app with `npm run dev`
3. Both trips should now load with proper photos

The public folder is now properly structured for your multi-trip platform!
