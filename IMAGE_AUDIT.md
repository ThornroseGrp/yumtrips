## üìù ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 - Fix Existing References
1. Update ice cream activity to not use island-provisions photo
2. Add sunrise photo to Saturday morning
3. Add inlet-view photos to optional lunch
4. Add southport-coffee photos to Sunday

### Priority 2 - Find/Create Missing Photos
1. Marsh boardwalk photo for Friday
2. Oak Island Lighthouse photo
3. Ice cream shop photo (Lil & John's)
4. Donut shop photo (OKI Scoop)

### Priority 3 - Consider Adding Charleston Activities
Since we have many Charleston photos (Angel Oak, cemetery, jail, waterfront), consider adding these as optional activities or mentioning them in the itinerary.
